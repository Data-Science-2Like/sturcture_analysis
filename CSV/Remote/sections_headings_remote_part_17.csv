Latex_files/full/expanded/190601998.tex,There are at least four main families of machine learning models for supervised learning,All machine learning methods perform similarly with some caveats,Neural networks are hard to train and weird stuff happens,If you dont use an interpretable model you can make bad mistakes,Explanations can be misleading and we cannot trust them,It is generally possible to find an accurateyetinterpretable model even for neural networks,Special properties such as decision making fairness or robustness must be built in,Causal inference is different than prediction correlation is not causation,There is a method to the madness of deep neural network architectures but not always,It is a myth that machine learning can do anything
